---

The Fourth Way of Gurdjieff is based on several laws and diagrams that help understand the functioning of the universe and the human being.

## [[Law of Three]]
The Law of Three states that every phenomenon results from the interaction of three forces: active, passive, and neutralizing.

## [[Law of Seven]]
The Law of Seven, or Law of Octaves, describes the cyclic process of every event, highlighting how changes occur through predictable intervals.

## [[Enneagram]]
The Enneagram is a nine-pointed diagram representing different personality types and dynamic processes of inner development.
