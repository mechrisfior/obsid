# Law of Three

The Law of Three is one of the fundamental principles of Gurdjieff's Fourth Way. According to this law, every phenomenon results from the interaction of three forces: active, passive, and neutralizing.

## Description of the Forces
- **Active Force**: The force that initiates an action or process.
- **Passive Force**: The force that resists or undergoes the action of the active force.
- **Neutralizing Force**: The force that reconciles or balances the other two forces, allowing the process to be completed.
