Gurdjieff's Fourth Way teachings have several correlations with Western magic traditions.

## [[Hermetic Symbolism]]
Many of Gurdjieff's symbols and ideas find parallels in Hermetic texts and alchemical traditions.

## [[Kabbalah and the Fourth Way]]
The structure of centers and diagrams like the Enneagram can be related to the Tree of Life in Kabbalah.

## [[Alchemy and Inner Transformation]]
The concept of inner transformation in the Fourth Way has many points in common with alchemical principles, aiming at the transmutation of the soul.
