GetResponse offers you three billing periods:

Monthly payment plans are bracketed by list size, starting at $19 per month for unlimited messages to 1,000 subscribers. With the discounts we offer, you can get 18% off a 12-month plan or 30% off a 24-month plan.

Downgrades can only be performed by the Support Team as per your request.
