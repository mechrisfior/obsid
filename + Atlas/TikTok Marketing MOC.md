### ACCESSING THE TIKTOK CREATOR REWARDS PROGRAM FROM ANYWHERE

‚Äé ‚Äé Here‚Äôs what you need to know: ‚Äé

## US Sim Card / US Account

The most crucial step to accessing CRP from around the world is getting your hands on a US SIM-card or account. This will make TikTok think you're from the US. It's actually simple, just purchase a US SIM-card online, then follow these steps:

1. Acquire a spare phone / purchase a used phone
2. Ensure the device is factory reset
3. Insert the US SIM-card
4. Complete the sim activation issued by the SIM provider
5. Reset the device
6. Download TikTok
7. Do not remove SIM-card
8. Done, the TikTok app can now be used as you normally would.

- US audience
- US RPM (1$+)
- Access to the CRP
- TikTok Shop access

Now that you have access to the Creator Rewards Program, you can start grinding to 10,000 followers. Or‚Ä¶ **You can get monetized from day 1 with a 0 follower CRP account.** To simplify it, Tiktok now offers a new program where you link a Youtube Account with 10,000 subscribers to TikTok, and get monetized in return.

### SHADOWBANS, SHADOWBANS & SHADOWBANS...

‚Äé ‚Äé‚Äé ‚Äé‚Äé ‚Äé Shadowbans can be EXTREMELY frustrating. I know that since I have been there countless times. But you can avoid it.

## Warming Up Your Account

This is the most important part for avoiding shadowbans. Common practices:

- Scroll on the FYP for a couple of days
- Few hours a day
- Engage on TikTok as a normal user (liking, commenting, etc.)

![:utility5:](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1235304549020074047.webp?size=44&quality=lossless) Don't overdo the liking, commenting, following. It should be a natural amount to make it look human to TikTok. Following every person in your feed will get your account shadowbanned. Some other things to keep in mind ![üëá](https://discordapp.com/assets/4d60e09c101c5d647403.svg)

- Don‚Äôt violate community guidelines
- Don't steal content
- Don‚Äôt have too many accounts on 1 device (4-5 is the limit)

Even if you follow the steps above, it's possible to get shadowbanned. If you ever need more help, our mentors offer 24/7 support in the Growth Program. ‚Å†üöÄ‚îÇupgrade here.

## Identifying Shadowbans

To identify if your account is shadowbanned:

1. Watch your views. If you consistently get low views (below 30), then you are shadowbanned.

2. If your videos can‚Äôt be seen by other accounts, you're shadowbanned.

3. If your follows don‚Äôt register after refreshing the page, you're shadowbanned.
