### ACCESSING THE TIKTOK CREATOR REWARDS PROGRAM FROM ANYWHERE

‚Äé ‚Äé Here‚Äôs what you need to know: ‚Äé

## US Sim Card / US Account

The most crucial step to accessing CRP from around the world is getting your hands on a US SIM-card or account. This will make TikTok think you're from the US. It's actually simple, just purchase a US SIM-card online, then follow these steps:

1. Acquire a spare phone / purchase a used phone
2. Ensure the device is factory reset
3. Insert the US SIM-card
4. Complete the sim activation issued by the SIM provider
5. Reset the device
6. Download TikTok
7. Do not remove SIM-card
8. Done, the TikTok app can now be used as you normally would.

- US audience
- US RPM (1$+)
- Access to the CRP
- TikTok Shop access

Now that you have access to the Creator Rewards Program, you can start grinding to 10,000 followers. Or‚Ä¶ **You can get monetized from day 1 with a 0 follower CRP account.** To simplify it, Tiktok now offers a new program where you link a Youtube Account with 10,000 subscribers to TikTok, and get monetized in return.

### SHADOWBANS, SHADOWBANS & SHADOWBANS...

‚Äé ‚Äé‚Äé ‚Äé‚Äé ‚Äé Shadowbans can be EXTREMELY frustrating. I know that since I have been there countless times. But you can avoid it.

## Warming Up Your Account

This is the most important part for avoiding shadowbans. Common practices:

- Scroll on the FYP for a couple of days
- Few hours a day
- Engage on TikTok as a normal user (liking, commenting, etc.)

![:utility5:](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1235304549020074047.webp?size=44&quality=lossless) Don't overdo the liking, commenting, following. It should be a natural amount to make it look human to TikTok. Following every person in your feed will get your account shadowbanned. Some other things to keep in mind ![üëá](https://discordapp.com/assets/4d60e09c101c5d647403.svg)

- Don‚Äôt violate community guidelines
- Don't steal content
- Don‚Äôt have too many accounts on 1 device (4-5 is the limit)

Even if you follow the steps above, it's possible to get shadowbanned. If you ever need more help, our mentors offer 24/7 support in the Growth Program. ‚Å†üöÄ‚îÇupgrade here.

## Identifying Shadowbans

To identify if your account is shadowbanned:

1. Watch your views. If you consistently get low views (below 30), then you are shadowbanned.

2. If your videos can‚Äôt be seen by other accounts, you're shadowbanned.

3. If your follows don‚Äôt register after refreshing the page, you're shadowbanned.

### FINDING A GOOD NICHE

‚Äé ‚Äé‚Äé ‚Äé Choosing your niche is the most important decision you will make, especially as a beginner. ‚Äé So make sure to pay extra attention to choose the right niche for you.

## How To Do It

To find niches, you need to scroll through your TikTok FYP.

1. Find content that is faceless, performs very well & easily could be automated.

2. Engage with the content when you've found a potential topic, such as AI content.

TikTok will start feeding you more similar content, and then you‚Äôll start to find niches you‚Äôve never seen.

3. Take all those ideas of new content and narrow it down to one.

When deciding on your niche, it's important that it meets specific criteria:

- Make sure videos in this niche are **currently** getting good views.
- It shouldn't be too saturated. If there are dozens of accounts attempting to try the same niche, competing with them will be hard.
- Analyse if the videos within the niche can have 1+ minute length and still perform well (only 1+ minute videos are eligible for CRP)
- Is the content sustainable to mass-produce? Can it be made easily yet have a high-perceived value?

Finding something you are passionate about always helps as when the times get tough, as it will be easier for you to stick through it. In the next module, we extracted some good niches from the niche list in ‚Å†üöÄ‚îÇupgrade.

**IMPORTANT:** These niches can get you started, but don‚Äôt just copy them. You need to put your own twist on them to stand out. Think about it: Reddit stories were great a while ago, but it's way too competitive to begin with nowadays. In order to succeed, you have to add unique elements to the style of the content.
