### ACCESSING THE TIKTOK CREATOR REWARDS PROGRAM FROM ANYWHERE

‚Äé ‚Äé Here‚Äôs what you need to know: ‚Äé

## US Sim Card / US Account

The most crucial step to accessing CRP from around the world is getting your hands on a US SIM-card or account. This will make TikTok think you're from the US. It's actually simple, just purchase a US SIM-card online, then follow these steps:

1. Acquire a spare phone / purchase a used phone
2. Ensure the device is factory reset
3. Insert the US SIM-card
4. Complete the sim activation issued by the SIM provider
5. Reset the device
6. Download TikTok
7. Do not remove SIM-card
8. Done, the TikTok app can now be used as you normally would.

![:utility5:](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1235304549020074047.webp?size=44&quality=lossless) Keep in mind you can do all this with your normal phone, without acquiring a spare one, but you will need to follow additional steps to not ruin the account. Either way, this will get you:

- US audience
- US RPM (1$+)
- Access to the CRP
- TikTok Shop access

Now that you have access to the Creator Rewards Program, you can start grinding to 10,000 followers. Or‚Ä¶ **You can get monetized from day 1 with a 0 follower CRP account.** To simplify it, Tiktok now offers a new program where you link a Youtube Account with 10,000 subscribers to TikTok, and get monetized in return.

### SHADOWBANS, SHADOWBANS & SHADOWBANS...

‚Äé ‚Äé‚Äé ‚Äé‚Äé ‚Äé Shadowbans can be EXTREMELY frustrating. I know that since I have been there countless times. But you can avoid it.

## Warming Up Your Account

This is the most important part for avoiding shadowbans. Common practices:

- Scroll on the FYP for a couple of days
- Few hours a day
- Engage on TikTok as a normal user (liking, commenting, etc.)

![:utility5:](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1235304549020074047.webp?size=44&quality=lossless) Don't overdo the liking, commenting, following. It should be a natural amount to make it look human to TikTok. Following every person in your feed will get your account shadowbanned. Some other things to keep in mind ![üëá](https://discordapp.com/assets/4d60e09c101c5d647403.svg)

- Don‚Äôt violate community guidelines
- Don't steal content
- Don‚Äôt have too many accounts on 1 device (4-5 is the limit)

Even if you follow the steps above, it's possible to get shadowbanned. If you ever need more help, our mentors offer 24/7 support in the Growth Program. ‚Å†üöÄ‚îÇupgrade here.

## Identifying Shadowbans

To identify if your account is shadowbanned:

1. Watch your views. If you consistently get low views (below 30), then you are shadowbanned.

2. If your videos can‚Äôt be seen by other accounts, you're shadowbanned.

3. If your follows don‚Äôt register after refreshing the page, you're shadowbanned.

Not shadowbanned? Let's start making money

### FINDING A GOOD NICHE

‚Äé ‚Äé‚Äé ‚Äé Choosing your niche is the most important decision you will make, especially as a beginner. ‚Äé So make sure to pay extra attention to choose the right niche for you.

## How To Do It

To find niches, you need to scroll through your TikTok FYP.

1. Find content that is faceless, performs very well & easily could be automated.

2. Engage with the content when you've found a potential topic, such as AI content.

TikTok will start feeding you more similar content, and then you‚Äôll start to find niches you‚Äôve never seen.

3. Take all those ideas of new content and narrow it down to one.

When deciding on your niche, it's important that it meets specific criteria:

- Make sure videos in this niche are **currently** getting good views.
- It shouldn't be too saturated. If there are dozens of accounts attempting to try the same niche, competing with them will be hard.
- Analyse if the videos within the niche can have 1+ minute length and still perform well (only 1+ minute videos are eligible for CRP)
- Is the content sustainable to mass-produce? Can it be made easily yet have a high-perceived value?

Finding something you are passionate about always helps as when the times get tough, as it will be easier for you to stick through it. In the next module, we extracted some good niches from the niche list in ‚Å†üöÄ‚îÇupgrade.

**IMPORTANT:** These niches can get you started, but don‚Äôt just copy them. You need to put your own twist on them to stand out. Think about it: Reddit stories were great a while ago, but it's way too competitive to begin with nowadays. In order to succeed, you have to add unique elements to the style of the content. Let's learn how to create the actual content
# MODULE 5

### CREATING THE CONTENT

‚Äé ‚Äé‚Äé Now that you have a niche its time to start posting. But.. ..the videos need to be high quality to go viral. A good video is a combination of several key components ![üëá](https://discordapp.com/assets/4d60e09c101c5d647403.svg)

## Good Hook

This might be the most important thing when creating your TikTok videos. It's said that the first 1-2 seconds of your video are the most important. The hook should immediately grab viewers' attention and make them want to keep watching. It should **invoke strong emotions.** **Controversy works well** to get viewers to stop their mindless scroll.

## Quality Script

This will also make or break your video. While a hook is key to capturing your viewer's attention, your script is what will determine the video's retention. Try not to rely on AI for your scripts too much, as it will make it nearly impossible to make scripts that are genuinely engaging. So drop ChatGPT and learn to write scripts yourself. This will allow you to get a MUCH BETTER understanding of what makes content good.

## Crisp Audio

You want to make sure your video has a good voice-over & music.

### COMMON PRACTICES / IMPORTANT KNOWLEDGE

‚Äé ‚Äé Here's some valuable information you can keep in mind when starting TikTok automation:

## POSTING

- **You need to post consistently**
    
    - Post 1-2 times a day and stick with it
    - Try your best to never miss a day
    

- **When posting a video make sure you don‚Äôt have too many hashtags**
    
    - Keep it around 3-5 good hashtags
    - Also note that hashtags aren't that important, so don‚Äôt get caught up on them.
    

## When To Swap Niche

There‚Äôs a chance that the niche you pick won‚Äôt be good, or perform well enough. You **need to know** when it‚Äôs time to switch paths. If you're posting consistent, high-quality videos for 2 weeks and have not gotten a post beyond 10,000 views.. **..switch niche.**

- Always keep up with trends to know if there's any major development in your niche that can help you go viral.

This can be done through supervising your competitors and analysing any viral content they post. Trendy memes can also be used in your content to boost engagement. A great example of this is the texting niche. Here's a regular texting niche account: [https://www.tiktok.com/@texty.stories.daily](https://www.tiktok.com/@texty.stories.daily "https://www.tiktok.com/@texty.stories.daily") Here's a new twist to the niche that emerged, causing some creators to BLOW UP: [https://www.tiktok.com/@mr.month](https://www.tiktok.com/@mr.month "https://www.tiktok.com/@mr.month") All they did was swap the AI voice-over to one that is singing. **And with that you should be able to make your first $$$ with TikTok.**
