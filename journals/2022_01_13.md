- ChrisFior.co | Then waking up I woke up to realitySo this morning I woke up and all illusions were gone.Not in a mystical sense, with some fluffy winged being imposing its ethereal hands on my chest.No.With Illusions I mean REAL illusions.With Illusions I mean that damn smoke ’n' mirror game all those sellers use to MKultra-ing your mind.To bend you believe you aren’t satisfied with what you already have.To bend you believe you have to do MUCH more than you are capable of.To bend you believe you are an evolved superior being came here to save the world.I stuffed my metaphorical mouth with illusions of “Be who you are”, “make a living with your passions”& “All is love and light and you’re gonna change the world”. Yeah, right.What’s wrong with the world? Why should I change such beautiful Creation?Am I God? or Christ? No. I’m not. I’m just a man and capable of wonderful things too.I don’t have to change the world, dear seller.I don’t WANT to change the world, dear seller.I don’t. Just DON’T and you shouldn't too, poor unsatisfied soul.What I have to do is taking care of my family.taking care of all those who ASK for help.Take care of my household and keep the fridge full.Thats what my centre of gravity should have been.And now, this morning this came to my understandingso CLEARLY, that I could not help to do anything otherwise.
